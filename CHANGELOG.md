# Changelog

All notable changes to Stokowski are documented here.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- feat: optionally scope each Linear tracker to issues assigned to the API key's authenticated user with `tracker.assignee: me`
- feat: configure reasoning effort for either runner with the shared per-state
  `effort` field, including `max` for Codex

### Changed

- fix: launch Codex through the current non-interactive `codex exec` command
- Use one `effort` field for Claude and Codex instead of a Codex-only
  `reasoning_effort` field.
- Refresh the Workflow Studio catalogue for GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna and Claude
  Opus/Sonnet/Haiku 5; remove the unavailable Fable entry.

### Fixed

- Stream readable Codex JSONL activity into the terminal and dashboard, drain diagnostic stderr concurrently, report hook completion and captured output, and kill the complete Codex process group after stalls or timeouts.
- Close Codex subprocess stdin so headless runs do not wait indefinitely for additional piped input.
- Run Codex with full workspace access so autonomous turns can create branches, commit changes, and update submodules.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-31

Runs are now measurable, and the workflow is visible without opening a file.

### Added

- feat: run ledger — an append-only record of every stage and every gate
  decision, plus `stokowski --stats` for approval rate by classification and by
  the agent's own stated confidence (7c1f1b7)
- feat: workflow studio at `/studio` — the pipeline at a glance and editing for
  the obvious knobs, with comment-preserving YAML round-trips and validation
  before any write (7c1f1b7)
- feat: the agent's stated confidence applied as a Linear label alongside the
  work type, so a board can be filtered by it (7c1f1b7)
- feat: `pnpm start` / `studio` / `check` / `stats` / `test` aliases wrapping a
  launcher that finds the CLI and the workflow file itself (7c1f1b7)
- feat: prompts now require before/after measurement for any measurable claim,
  carry deployment preview URLs, name paired screenshots so they render as a
  pair, and check open PRs before touching shared code (7c1f1b7)

### Fixed

- fix: prompt files referenced by a state are now checked for existence. A
  typo'd path previously passed startup and every dry run, then failed when the
  agent launched (7c1f1b7)
- fix: literal `/api/v1` routes are declared before the
  `/api/v1/{issue_identifier}` catch-all, which was swallowing them
  (7c1f1b7)
- fix: the orchestrator no longer reads `self.cfg` during construction, which
  raised AssertionError on startup because the workflow is not loaded until the
  first tick (7c1f1b7)
- fix: releases merged without squashing are now detected. v1.0.0 was merged
  normally, the release Action found no match, reported success and shipped
  nothing — its tag had to be created by hand (5f27cfb)

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-31

First release where Stokowski can account for what its agents did, prove it,
and show its working.

### Added

- feat: parse the real stream-json event shape — tool calls, thinking, tool
  errors, rate-limit windows and per-run cost, split into `events.py` and
  tested against an unedited capture (4e5231d)
- feat: expandable per-agent activity timelines in the dashboard, plus real
  cost, cache read/write split and the five-hour rate-limit window in both the
  dashboard and the CLI footer (4e5231d)
- feat: agent evidence — screenshots and exports written to
  `.stokowski/artifacts/`, uploaded to the Linear issue and cleared locally,
  isolated from the project repo via `.git/info/exclude` (4e5231d)
- feat: Stokowski renders Linear comments from a structured agent report;
  unsourced claims are published with a warning marker rather than dropped
  (4e5231d)
- feat: run classification applied as a Linear label — `stokowski/bug-fix`,
  `stokowski/improvement`, `stokowski/prototype` and others (4e5231d)
- feat: `ground-check` stage between investigation and the first human gate,
  running a fresh session to reproduce data sources and re-derive headline
  numbers (4e5231d)
- ci: run the test suite on pushes and pull requests across Python 3.11 and
  3.13, and dry-run the shipped example workflow (4e5231d)

### Fixed

- fix: token accounting ignored cache tokens and read a `total_tokens` field
  that does not exist, understating usage by roughly two orders of magnitude;
  usage was also overwritten per turn rather than accumulated, so multi-turn
  runs reported only their final turn. Cost was not reported at all
  (4e5231d)
- fix: tool activity never reached the dashboard — the parser looked for a
  top-level `tool_use` event the CLI does not emit (4e5231d)
- fix: the session id is now taken from `system/init`, so a stalled or
  timed-out turn stays resumable instead of restarting from scratch
  (4e5231d)
- fix: slash commands and skills are no longer banned in headless runs; the
  constraint is interactivity, not tooling (4e5231d)
- fix: example workspace hooks — `npm install` fails outright on a pnpm or
  yarn workspace, `--depth 1` breaks the review stage's diff, `before_run`
  exited 128 on a dirty working tree and failed every turn, and the hook
  timeout was too short for a cold install (4e5231d)
- fix: example prompts told agents to post Linear comments Stokowski now posts
  itself, and to run a code review skill the system prompt forbade
  (4e5231d)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** agents no longer author their own Linear summary comments.
  Custom prompts instructing them to do so will produce duplicates — remove
  those instructions, as the reporting contract is injected automatically
  (4e5231d)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- feat: auto-start the web dashboard when `server.port` is set in config — no `--port` flag required; adds `server.host` config and a `--host` CLI flag (8f50d3b)
- feat: structured logging that tags log records with the issue they relate to via a `linked_to` field (66366fc)
- feat: show last-activity timestamps for running agents in both the dashboard and CLI status table (7611621)
- feat: live log panel in the dashboard — server-sent-events log stream with per-issue filtering, auto-scroll, and clear (008e121)

### Fixed

- fix: guard `server.host` resolution against an unloaded config so invalid configs fail with the clean startup error instead of an AttributeError (#38)
- fix: reconcile gates against Linear truth on each tick and at startup (#24)
- fix: route gate-approve through `_transition` for proper target-type dispatch (#22)
- fix: read blocker from `IssueRelation.issue`, not `relatedIssue` (#21)

### Changed

- fix: responsive font sizes in the dashboard using rem units and a width breakpoint (4fba2c7)

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- feat: pass workflow.yaml Linear credentials (`api_key`, `project_slug`, `endpoint`) to agent subprocesses as env vars — agents now use the same Linear credentials as Stokowski without relying on shell environment (770206c)

### Changed

- docs: workflow.yaml is now the single source of truth for Linear credentials — removed `.env.example` and updated README setup guide (a9ed097)
- docs: update README intro to position Stokowski as building beyond Symphony (a9ed097)

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- feat: add todo state — pick up issues from Todo and move to In Progress automatically (94b9d02)

### Fixed

- fix: single turn per dispatch in state machine mode — agents no longer blow past stage boundaries (ee8f0f6)
- fix: prevent re-dispatch loop when gate state transition fails — keep issue claimed and retry (60f391f)
- fix: include lifecycle context in multi-turn continuation prompts (ca82942)
- fix: increase subprocess stdout buffer to 10MB to handle large NDJSON lines (a346125)
- fix: check return value of `update_issue_state` at all call sites (6347584)
- fix: Linear 400 on state update — use `team.states` instead of `workflowStates` filter (77a0bad)
- fix: make `_SilentUndefined` inherit from `jinja2.Undefined` (1b6ddb3)
- fix: read `__version__` from package metadata instead of hardcoded string (ae74016)

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- feat: add todo state — pick up issues from Todo and move to In Progress automatically (94b9d02)

### Fixed

- fix: read `__version__` from package metadata instead of hardcoded string — update checker now shows correct version (ae74016)

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- fix: exclude `prompts/` from setuptools package discovery — fresh installs failed with "Multiple top-level packages" error (de001b4)
- fix: `project.license` deprecation warning — switched to SPDX string format (de001b4)

### Changed

- docs: rewrite Emdash comparison for accuracy — now an open-source desktop app with 22+ agent CLIs (15d15d4)
- docs: expand "What Stokowski adds beyond Symphony" with state machine, multi-runner, and prompt assembly sections (15d15d4)
- docs: clarify workflow diagram is a configurable example, not a fixed pipeline (f9879b6)

---

- feat: Linear comment creation, comment fetching, and issue state mutation methods (`linear.py`) (e475351)
- feat: `on_stage_enter` lifecycle hook (`config.py`) (c5852c4)
- feat: Codex runner stall detection and timeout handling (`runner.py`) (db58f04)

- feat: pipeline stage config dataclasses and validation (`config.py`) (8b769d8, a4dd34d)
- docs: example `workflow.yaml` and `prompts/*.example.md` files (da63359, da7d8bb)

### Fixed

- fix: gate claiming, duplicate comments, crash recovery, codex timeout (8f2ac3f)
- fix: transition key mismatch — example config used `success`, orchestrator expected `complete` (b18da0a)
- fix: use `<br/>` for line breaks in Mermaid node labels (754711f)

### Changed

- refactor: `WORKFLOW.md` (YAML front matter + prompt body) replaced by `workflow.yaml` + `prompts/` directory (c0109d9)
- refactor: `TrackerConfig.active_states` / `terminal_states` replaced by `LinearStatesConfig` mapping (c0109d9)
- refactor: `RunAttempt.stage` renamed to `state_name`, `runner_type` field removed (f0ccd48)
