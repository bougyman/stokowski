"""Append-only record of what agents did and how it was judged.

Stokowski keeps no database — state lives in memory and is rebuilt from Linear
on restart. That is fine for scheduling and useless for the question that
actually matters once you are running dozens of tickets a week: is this
working, and for what?

Nothing else answers that. The Linear issue holds one run's report; it cannot
tell you that `bug-fix` work lands 90% of the time while `improvement` work
lands half the time, or whether the agent's own `high` confidence means
anything. Those are the numbers that decide how much review a class of ticket
needs, and they only exist if something writes them down as they happen.

The human verdict is taken from the gate decisions already in the workflow: an
approved gate is work a person accepted, a rework is work they sent back. No
extra rating step, no separate feedback UI — the judgement is already being
made, it was simply never recorded.

One JSON object per line, appended, never rewritten. A corrupt or partial line
is skipped on read rather than taking the summary down with it.
