"""Tests for the shipped example workflow and prompts.

These are not decoration. The examples are what operators copy and, in our own
case, run directly — so a stale instruction in an example is a stale
instruction in production. Two whole classes of bug shipped from exactly that:
prompts telling agents to "run a code review skill" while the system prompt
banned skills, and prompts telling agents to post Linear comments after
Stokowski took over that job.

Anything asserted here is a promise the examples make to the agent. If a
promise changes, change it in one place and let these fail loudly.
